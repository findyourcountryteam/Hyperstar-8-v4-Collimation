Hyperstar 8 v4 Initial Setup and Collimation: Getting a Flat Field and Sharp Stars

Many users of Starizona’s Hyperstar system manage to configure their image trains to get really wonderful images. Others don’t have the same experience. This documentation is for the folks in latter camp, who really want to get into the former camp.

We’ll try to stay out of the theoretical weeds in this document, and stick to the concepts that you need to know to really enjoy the Hyperstar system. Although tolerances within this optical system are measured in microns, which alone is a recipe for frustration and hair-loss, there are elegant methods to setup and collimate the Hyperstar. Anyone owning Hyperstar owes it to themselves to take a few minutes and review the basics and the workflows recommended by it’s manufacturer, Starizona. It looks daunting at first, but read on, and you’ll see for yourself just how easy it is.

## Center the Corrector Plate
> [!IMPORTANT]
> KA corrector plate that is centered (optically “on-axis”) is the foundation for everything else described in this documentation. Without a centered corrector plate, you will not get a flat field or sharp stars in your images. You’ll might even think there’s something wrong with the Hyperstar itself.

Set up the SCT securely on it’s mount and tilt it toward you so that you can comfortably look straight down into the corrector. The telescope should not point horizontally, or point down.

Set camera on tripod 7 ft away, so that it has a view straight down into the telescope and you can see the dark, “concentric rings” pattern. Look at the camera’s image and focus, zoom, or whatever is necessary to clearly see the pattern of concentric rings.

Here’s an example of a well-centered corrector plate. Note that all circles a perfectly concentric – they are evenly spaced in all directions.
