_Hyperstar 8 v4 Initial Set Up and Collimation: Getting a Flat Field and Sharp Stars_

Many users of Starizona’s Hyperstar system manage to configure their image trains to get wonderful images. Others don’t have the same experience. This documentation is for the folks in the latter camp, who want to get into the former camp.

We’ll try to stay out of the theoretical weeds in this document and stick to the concepts you need to know to enjoy the Hyperstar system. Although tolerances within this optical system are measured in microns, proving a recipe for frustration and hair loss, there are elegant methods to set up and collimate the Hyperstar. Anyone owning Hyperstar owes it to themselves to take a few minutes and review the basics and the workflows recommended by its manufacturer, Starizona. It looks daunting at first, but read on, and you’ll see how easy it is.

## Center the Corrector Plate
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A corrector plate that is centered (optically “on-axis”) is the foundation for everything else described in this documentation. Without a centered corrector plate, you will not get a flat field or sharp stars in your images. You might even think there’s something wrong with the Hyperstar itself.

Secure the SCT on its mount and tilt it slightly upward, toward you, so that you can look straight down into the corrector. The telescope should not point horizontally or down.

Set the camera on a tripod 7 ft away, so that it points straight down into the telescope and you can see the dark, concentric rings pattern. Look at the camera’s image and focus, zoom, or whatever is necessary to clearly see the pattern of concentric rings.

Here’s an example of a well-centered corrector plate. Note that all circles are perfectly concentric – they are evenly spaced in all directions.

Here is an example of a corrector that is not centered. Notice the uneven spacing.

Remove screws holding dew heater or original retaining ring. Note how “loose” these screws are. They are not tightened down. They are firm enough to hold the retaining ring in place.

You make adjustments to center the corrector plate until it appears optically “on-axis”, and all the circles are a concentric as you can get them.

You don’t center the corrector plate relative to it’s enclosure. In fact, for my corrector plate, to be on-axis, it definitely sits to one side in it’s enclosure.

Mark the edge of the corrector plate, and the edge of the corrector plate enclosure (“Orientation Marks” in the following diagram) so that if the corrector plate moves one way or the other in it’s clockwise orientation, you can return to the precise orientation. It’s argued back-and-forth online about whether the clockwise positioning (aka “clocking”) of the corrector plate matters. One camp is convinced that the optics are tested and committed at the factory, and that straying from the factory orientation of the corrector will produce sub-optimal results. The other camp calls it a “corrector” and claims there is no difference. Some claim it’s relevant for older scopes and not the newer ones. I prefer to play it safe, as rediscovering the optimal orientation of the corrector plate is not a task I’m equipped to do, neither financially nor from a time perspective.

Use the instructions in the following image to center the corrector plate.

Replace the retainer ring and reattach the three screws. Note that these do not need to be tight, but are there to secure the ring in place.

## Check For The Correct Backfocus
Backfocus for a Hyperstar system is critical. This means that the camera sensor must be a precise distance from the Hyperstar lens. Even a very small error of 0.2mm too far or too close is noticeable in your images. 
The following image is an example of the star pattern caused by a sensor that is too close to the Hyperstar lens. The back focus needs to be increased.

![Example of backfocus too close](Camera_sensor_too_close.png)

This next image is an example of the star pattern caused by a sensor that is too far away from the Hyperstar lens. The back focus needs to be decreased. (Thank you to Helmut Eichler and OPT for the images!)

To ensure accurate backfocus, Starizona outfits the Hyperstar v4 or the Hyperstar v4 + (new) Modular Filter Drawer with the correct camera adapter at time of purchase. In other words, if you’ve screwed everything together correctly, and you Zero Out The Hyperstar, the backfocus should be correct. If you’re not entirely sure if you have the right adapter for your configuration, just email Starizona for confirmation.

> [!TIP]
> Zero Out The Hyperstar before you test for backfocus. Note that you will most likely still need to finely collimate the system.

If you need to increase the distance, either because the native distance needs adjustment – or because you’ve added a filter (which increases backfocus by 1/3 the thickness of the filter), you can buy M48 (T2) fine-adjustment spacers. Aluminum is a better material than the plastics available, and getting a set that includes a 0.3mm spacer is good. Very, very small adjustments make a big difference.
