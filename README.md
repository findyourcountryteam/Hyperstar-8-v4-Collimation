Hyperstar 8 v4 Initial Set Up and Collimation: Getting a Flat Field and Sharp Stars

Many users of Starizona’s Hyperstar system manage to configure their image trains to get wonderful images. Others don’t have the same experience. This documentation is for the folks in the latter camp, who want to get into the former camp.

We’ll try to stay out of the theoretical weeds in this document and stick to the concepts you need to know to enjoy the Hyperstar system. Although tolerances within this optical system are measured in microns, proving a recipe for frustration and hair loss, there are elegant methods to set up and collimate the Hyperstar. Anyone owning Hyperstar owes it to themselves to take a few minutes and review the basics and the workflows recommended by its manufacturer, Starizona. It looks daunting at first, but read on, and you’ll see how easy it is.

## Center the Corrector Plate
> [!IMPORTANT]
> A corrector plate that is centered (optically “on-axis”) is the foundation for everything else described in this documentation. Without a centered corrector plate, you will not get a flat field or sharp stars in your images. You might even think there’s something wrong with the Hyperstar itself.

Secure the SCT on its mount and tilt it slightly upward, toward you, so that you can look straight down into the corrector. The telescope should not point horizontally or down.

Set the camera on a tripod 7 ft away, so that it points straight down into the telescope and you can see the dark, concentric rings pattern. Look at the camera’s image and focus, zoom, or whatever is necessary to clearly see the pattern of concentric rings.

Here’s an example of a well-centered corrector plate. Note that all circles are perfectly concentric – they are evenly spaced in all directions.
